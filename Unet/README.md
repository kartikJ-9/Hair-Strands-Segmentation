I implemented Unet Architecture, a specific type of Convolutional Neural Network that is used on Biological images.
My approach turned out to be a transfer learning paradigm. Similar Unet implementation was dodne on Salt identification challenge in the kaggle.

Following resources came handy while implementing Unet on Hair Strand Segmentation:

Performance:

Unet gives 82% accuracy. There is a need for more data for the model to fit well.
